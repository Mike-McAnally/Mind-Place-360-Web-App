# Mind Place 360 Web App
I've have had a 360 degree camera for a while now. Also, I have a Oculus Quest 2 VR headset (or now Meta Quest 2).

Combining these two pieces of hardware with a tripod, some long video processing time, a webserver, some open source A-frame WebXR, and it is possible to fully capture immersive 360 experiences in virtual reality over the internet. And even share them with others.

Moments whch can be replayed, memories recalled. I call it Mind Place because it helps me remember important events, video logs, and expereinces in my mind and its a data structure in itself, which I am building up slowly over time.
